# Energy Utilization and Optimization Using Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning
This project explores how **data analytics** and **machine learning** can improve the efficiency of cloud systems. It applies:

- **Descriptive analytics** to understand past system performance  
- **Predictive analytics** to anticipate future patterns and potential issues  
- **Prescriptive analytics** to recommend better ways to manage resources  

Machine learning models are used to identify patterns, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions for energy savings and system efficiency.

The goal is to improve performance, reduce delays, and use energy more effectively, especially in environments that need to scale reliably.

## Background and Overview

Cloud service providers are under pressure to deliver high-performance infrastructure while keeping energy use and costs under control. As more businesses move their operations to the cloud, data centers are consuming more energy than ever.

This rise in energy demand leads to:

- Higher carbon emissions  
- Increased operational costs  

This project explores these issues using a dataset that includes performance metrics from a simulated cloud computing environment.

### Key Challenges

- High energy consumption  
- Inefficient resource use  
- Delayed task execution  

### Who This Helps

- Businesses that depend on efficient, scalable, and cost-effective cloud services
